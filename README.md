# DD2438-Multi_agent_systems 

### (Under construction...)
This repository includes solutions to 5 different multi agent problems: Multi-agent collision avoidance,
the Vehicle Routing Problem........


## Multi-agent collision avoidance (P21)
Given the starting and the goal positions of N vehicles, the goal is to control the vehicles so as to arrive to their goals
in the minimum time possible without colliding. The vehicle is assumed to have a radius of 0.5 distance units.


## Multi-agent collision avoidance (P22)
Given the starting and the goal positions of N vehicles, the goal is to find or approximate the optimal trajectories so that the vehicles reach their goals after passing from a set of points of interest (e.g. customers).
